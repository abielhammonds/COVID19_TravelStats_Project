# COVID19_TravelStats_Project
An analysis of weekly COVID case numbers compared with weekly TSA traveller counts and a display of trends.

Data sources:

COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data: 
    https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf
    The data was called in using the API link because the .csv export was too large for my local machine
    and for GitHub.
    
TSA checkpoint travel numbers for 2020 and 2019:
    https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput

The COVID-19 data file is to large to push to github.  
It will remain on my local machine but can be downloaded or called via API from the CDC link provided.
